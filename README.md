This project visualizes transient heat transfer in 2-D of nominal PWR Uranium-Oxide fuel element. It does so by solving the time-dependent 2-D radial heat conduction equation, then saving the temperature fields for display once done.

To run this and view it for yourself simply clone the repository (or donwload all files individually), load them into your favorite python code software, make sure all files are in the same directory, and run main.py. Thats it! Just input the values you want to see a transient for (within the bounds) and hit submit!
